# ⚡ Vibe Coding Lab: Generative Web Experiments

**"A curious-filled lab of experimental web coding, rapidly prototyped and shaped using powerful Generative AI models."**

This repository is dedicated to exploring the intersection of generative AI and complex front-end development. We use AI assistants (like Gemini) to quickly build intricate web projects that would traditionally take hours or days to set up.
